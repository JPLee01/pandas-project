## 1 Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This analysis of Fisher\'s Iris Flower Data Set has been carried out as
an assignment of the Programming & Scripting Module. The aim of this
assignment is to help the student gain a practical experience in data
handling within Python, including data types and structures handling,
data splicing, plots generation and interpretation.

## 2 Project Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Project Repository is the source where all the work associated with
the project will be stored. It contains the following files and can be
located [here](https://github.com/JPLee01/pandas-project):

## 3 Fishers Iris Data Set
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3.1 Background

The data analysed in this project is the \"Iris Flower Data
Set\"[1](#references) This data set was collected by R.A. Fisher and presented
as a data set in 1936 in his paper \"The Use of Multiple Measurements in
Taxonomic Problems.\"[2](#references) In this paper Fisher studied the
use of linear combinations of multiple characterising features of a
species to discriminate it from related species. Within the paper Fisher
studied the following three related species of Iris flowers:

Fifty samples of each species were collected and analysed. (It should be
noted that the data for the Setosa and Iris Versicolor were already
available from a previous study by Fishers colleague Botanist Edgar
Anderson). Within each species Fisher studied four distinct
characteristics:

1.  Sepal Length

2.  Sepal Width

3.  Petal Length

4.  Petal Width

These characteristics can be seen below:

## 4  Problem Statement
As part of the assignmnent the student was given a set of instruction which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/JPLee01/pandas-project/blob/master/Project%20Instructions.pdf). As seen, within the instrctions a problem statement was printed. It stated that this project will invovle an analysis of the Iris data set. Python code will be utilised for this analysis and the student will be required to give explanations of the python code. The problem statement also explained it was required for the project that a program(s) be created that:
* outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
* saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
* outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
