Introduction
============

This analysis of Fisher\'s Iris Flower Data Set has been carried out as
an assignment of the Programming & Scripting Module. The aim of this
assignment is to help the student gain a practical experience in data
handling within Python, including data types and structures handling,
data splicing, plots generation and interpretation.

Project Repository
==================

The Project Repository is the source where all the work associated with
the project will be stored. It contains the following files and can be
located [here](https://github.com/JPLee01/pandas-project):

Fishers Iris Data Set
=====================

**3.1 Background**
------------------

The data analysed in this project is the \"Iris Flower Data
Set\"[^1^](\l) This data set was collected by R.A. Fisher and presented
as a data set in 1936 in his paper \"The Use of Multiple Measurements in
Taxonomic Problems.\"[^2^](#references) In this paper Fisher studied the
use of linear combinations of multiple characterising features of a
species to discriminate it from related species. Within the paper Fisher
studied the following three related species of Iris flowers:

![Machine learning-Iris classification - Jebaseelan Ravi -
Medium](media/image1.jpeg){width="6.263888888888889in"
height="1.8770833333333334in"}

Fifty samples of each species were collected and analysed. (It should be
noted that the data for the Setosa and Iris Versicolor were already
available from a previous study by Fishers colleague Botanist Edgar
Anderson). Within each species Fisher studied four distinct
characteristics:

1.  Sepal Length

2.  Sepal Width

3.  Petal Length

4.  Petal Width

These characteristics can be seen below:
